Most word processors have a feature
called word wrap, which automatically
moves the user’s next word down a line
when the right margin is reached. To
explore how this feature works, write a
program that allows the user to reformat
the text in a file. The user should input
the line width in characters and input
the names of the input and output files.
The program should then input the words
from the file into a list of sublists.
Each sublist represents a line of text to
be output to the file. As the words are
input into each sublist, the program
tracks the length of that line to ensure
that it is less than or equal to the
user’s line length. When all the words
have been entered into the sublists, the
program should traverse them to write
their contents to the output file.
