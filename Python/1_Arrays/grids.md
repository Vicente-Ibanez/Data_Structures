# Grids

Two-dimensional array.

Ex: Tables with rows/column

Rectangular Grid

Ragged Grid
* Has fixed # of rows
* Columns of data in each row can vary

Dimensions can be added to the definition of a grid as needed
* But can start to take up a lot of computer's memory.

Can do get_depth, get_width, and get_height
